<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

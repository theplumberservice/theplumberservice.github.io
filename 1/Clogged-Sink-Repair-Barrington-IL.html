<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>

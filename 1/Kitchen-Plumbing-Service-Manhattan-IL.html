<p>Before our professional technicians can start using their skills and experience, we first need to make sure that the line is properly cleaned and prepared for our repair work. Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>

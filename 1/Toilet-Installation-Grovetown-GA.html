<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises?

During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

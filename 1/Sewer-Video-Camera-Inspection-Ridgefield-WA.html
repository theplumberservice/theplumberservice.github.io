<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Ridgefield WA</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system. The water flowing backwards from a cross-connection might infect the drinking water system. Lawn irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs are common cross-connection points.

<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your sinks, bath tubs, and showers to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working properly that's truly all you need to learn about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the proficiency to detect an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>You need to spend a minimum of $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient finish mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>

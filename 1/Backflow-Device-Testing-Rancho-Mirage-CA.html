<p>Tankless water heaters are often called on-demand water heaters. These water heating systems develop hot water as it is needed by heating the water that streams from your water pipe to your tap, bypassing the need for a tank. A tankless hot water heater frequently costs less to run over its lifetime, but usually costs more upfront than tank water heaters. Depending upon your needs, you might need more than one tankless water heater to meet your day-to-day hot water demands.</p>

<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Angleton TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To avoid deterioration from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by bring in destructive products. By having the anode rod checked routinely and replaced as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

The clearing of blockages in fixture branches; the repairing of incidental leaks in fixtures, valves or pipes; or the removal and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing home appliances, non-testable backflow gadgets, and plumbing appurtenances; supplied that such repairs do not require the replacement or involve of hidden piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or components.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to consider.

Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were fantastic at repairing the clogged drain, however very very careless about fixing the chip in the sink and using puddy under the sink.</p>

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

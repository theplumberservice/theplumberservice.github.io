Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and stable  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>

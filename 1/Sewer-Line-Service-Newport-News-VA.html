<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>

<p>Examine the home's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and offered for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>

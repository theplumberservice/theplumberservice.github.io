<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

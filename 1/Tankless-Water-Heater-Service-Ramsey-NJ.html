<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that specific factor. However while little drips should not be cause for concern, house owners ought to watch on the water heater leaks. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was cheaper than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>

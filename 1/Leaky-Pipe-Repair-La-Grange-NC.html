<p>Odd Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to go through. Since of the tight space, the pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>

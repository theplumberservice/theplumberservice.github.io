<p>When they have to fit local water and sewer capacities, Garbage disposal systems might cost more. The plumbing in the house should work well or backup can happen, and septic tanks might need to be upgraded to work with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>

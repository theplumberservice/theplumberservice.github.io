<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

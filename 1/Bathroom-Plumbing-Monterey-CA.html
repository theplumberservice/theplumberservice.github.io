<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

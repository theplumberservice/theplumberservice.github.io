It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.

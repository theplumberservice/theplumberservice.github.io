Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

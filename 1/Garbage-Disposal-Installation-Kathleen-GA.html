<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a building. Plumbing inspections guarantee that water supply in buildings are linked properly, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water systems.

Warm water heaters are also inspected to make certain that they have actually been set up properly, to prevent a surge.</p>

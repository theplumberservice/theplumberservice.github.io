<p>Buying a home is a big financial investment. Understanding if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when negotiating the sale of a home.

Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>

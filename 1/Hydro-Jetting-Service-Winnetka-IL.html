<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Everyone who's installed a few disposals knows this error: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you've changed the flapper, the issue might be bigger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal appropriately, producing waste and a higher water expense.</p>

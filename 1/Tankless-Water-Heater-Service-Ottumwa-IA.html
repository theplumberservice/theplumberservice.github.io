<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>

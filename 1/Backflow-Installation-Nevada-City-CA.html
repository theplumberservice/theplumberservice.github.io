Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other.

<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Skaneateles NY</h3>

Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is deemed to not present a danger to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

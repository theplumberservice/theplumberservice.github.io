<p>Debating whether to repair or replace your hot water heater? Our experts will offer you a sincere recommendation. In general, older water heaters (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are better off being changed.

Old-fashioned water softeners are well-known for causing a spike in the cost of your regular monthly energy bills. Many require large amounts of water and can be expensive for the electrical energy bill, however the NuvoH2O system is different. Our saltless WATER conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and needs no electrical power.</p>
<p>When identifying the firmness of water, there are ranges of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is thought about very difficult water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to impossible to remove. With well water, these symptoms may also be paired with iron discolorations and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>

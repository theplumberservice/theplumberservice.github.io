<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

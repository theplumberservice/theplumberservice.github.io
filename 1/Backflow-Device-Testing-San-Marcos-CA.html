<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a new or remodelled structure is installed by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Clogs in a component can cause damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

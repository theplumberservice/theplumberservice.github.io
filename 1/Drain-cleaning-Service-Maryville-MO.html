It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to fully clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a consistent clogging issue.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning toilet is one household problem most of us would rather prevent. Nevertheless, you can not disregard a toilet issue. Leakages can cause your water expense to increase, and some leaks and obstructions can develop unhygienic conditions. If you've come across a toilet repair you can't deal with, call the pros at Benjamin Franklin Plumbing ® of Orlando. We can likewise supply replacement and installation services. We guarantee all our work. Our toilet plumbing specialists serve residents in Orlando, Winter Season Garden, Altamonte Springs, Goldenrod and surrounding Florida communities.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

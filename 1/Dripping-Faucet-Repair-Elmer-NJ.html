<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

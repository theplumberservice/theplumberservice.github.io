<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

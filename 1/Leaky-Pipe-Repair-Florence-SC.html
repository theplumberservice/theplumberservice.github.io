<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

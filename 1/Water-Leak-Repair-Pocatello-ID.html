Sediment Accumulation: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction impact and draw possible contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are typically discovered in a lot of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>

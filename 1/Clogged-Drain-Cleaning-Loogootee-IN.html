Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>No hot water-- The absence of warm water is the biggest sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio water heater. If you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower, then you may have sediment that has built up in the system and separated the water from the heat source. It's time to seek advice from the specialists if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>

A typical protective device called a backflow preventer (BFP) can be set up within the plumbing system to effectively shut-off the house or business from the street sewer system during sewage back-ups.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.

The typical hot water tank will last for 8-12 years so repairs or replacement is something that you need to anticipate to handle a number of times. When your water heater starts to leak, you have to install a new one quickly. A clogged drain needs to never be ignored. A clogged drain can create more costly damage if left unattended.

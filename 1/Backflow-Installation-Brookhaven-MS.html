<p>Backpressure might occur when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not appropriately secured.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner.

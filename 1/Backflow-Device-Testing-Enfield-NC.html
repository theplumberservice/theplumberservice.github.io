<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to solve the problem. Other times a more substantial solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>11. Munn, P. (2012 ). Results from testing corrosivity of difficult and softened water in design main heating unit at BSI, Loughborough." Midland Rust Services Ltd. Like any other system that gets frequent, ongoing use, your house's pipes go through routine wear and tear. Eventually, these pipes will need to be changed entirely.

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is accountable for protecting the water supply by guaranteeing, through plan evaluation and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are likewise responsible for ensuring the waste plumbing is appropriately vented and trapped so the plumbing securely carries run out while triggering no illness.</p>

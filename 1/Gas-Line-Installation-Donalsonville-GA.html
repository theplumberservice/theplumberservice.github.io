<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>

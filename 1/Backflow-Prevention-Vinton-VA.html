<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally sodium. Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a very small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about really low salt" by the Fda.</p>

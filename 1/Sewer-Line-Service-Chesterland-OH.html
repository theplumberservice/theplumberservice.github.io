<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak.

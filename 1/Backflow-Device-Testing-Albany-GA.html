<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably easy system, despite their significance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your company, where irrigation meets the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

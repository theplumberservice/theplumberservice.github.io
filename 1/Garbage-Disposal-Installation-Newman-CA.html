<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

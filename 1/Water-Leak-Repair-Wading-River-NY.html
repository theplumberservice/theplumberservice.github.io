<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

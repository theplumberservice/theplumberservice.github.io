<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water solidity if you don't see limescale accumulation however instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting scratchy and delicate. If you smell gas, do not attempt to locate the leak. Rather, leave your house or building right now. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge could develop a trigger. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation.

<p>House owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a brand-new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running efficiently. Enzymes are germs that feed on raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This all-natural service is effective and safe.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

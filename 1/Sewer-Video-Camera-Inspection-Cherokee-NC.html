It is necessary that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

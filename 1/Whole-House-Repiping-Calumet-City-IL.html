<h3>Leaky Faucets in Calumet City IL 60409 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>If you are seeking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, first consider your options. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be essential. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better alternative.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

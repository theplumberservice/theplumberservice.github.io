<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a safe and stable  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing.

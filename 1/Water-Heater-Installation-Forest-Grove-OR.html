<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

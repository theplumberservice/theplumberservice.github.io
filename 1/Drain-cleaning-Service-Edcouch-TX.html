We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>

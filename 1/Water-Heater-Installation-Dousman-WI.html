<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.

Shower heads utilizing water treated by a water softening system, on the other hand, carried out almost as well as on the day they were installed.</p>

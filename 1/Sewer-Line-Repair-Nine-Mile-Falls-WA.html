<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the procedure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to reveal the intensity of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating corrosion Co2 will potentially contribute to the development of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>

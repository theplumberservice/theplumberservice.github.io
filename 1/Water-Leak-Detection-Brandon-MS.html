Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

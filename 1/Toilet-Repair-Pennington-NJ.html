<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

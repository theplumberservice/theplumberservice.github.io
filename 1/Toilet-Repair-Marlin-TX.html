You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon circulation, smell, taste or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require changing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

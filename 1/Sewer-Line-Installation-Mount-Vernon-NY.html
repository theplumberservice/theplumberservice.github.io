<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>

This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater very rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with many property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>

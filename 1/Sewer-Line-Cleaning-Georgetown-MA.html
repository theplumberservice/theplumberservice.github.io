<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

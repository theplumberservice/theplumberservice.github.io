<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Henderson NC</h3>

Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

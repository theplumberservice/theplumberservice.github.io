If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you notice water coming back in your sink or shower? This might indicate that the water does not have a clear course to do through, more than likely since of a blocked drain. This is also the very best time to add the cable and plug to your disposal.

<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in Salem</h2>

<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

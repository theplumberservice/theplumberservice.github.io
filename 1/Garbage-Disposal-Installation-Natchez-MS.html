<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.

<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are incredibly essential to constructing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>High water pressure likewise harms plumbing. The water entering into the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure leads to leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without appropriate pressure decrease.

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

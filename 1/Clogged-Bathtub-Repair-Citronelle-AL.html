<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

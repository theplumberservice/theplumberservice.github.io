<p>When a gas line is burst, it instantly becomes a major security hazard.

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they cake to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes.

If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it results in additional damage and even costlier repairs.</p>

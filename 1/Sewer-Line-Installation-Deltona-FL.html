<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

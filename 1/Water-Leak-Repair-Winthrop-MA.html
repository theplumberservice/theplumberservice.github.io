<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during construction of a new or renovated building is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining component itself. Obstructions in a fixture can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>

<p>The traditional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It loses energy by holding the temperature level of water that is not currently in usage. Unlike residential pools, public or neighborhood swimming pools need to utilize just RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or neighborhood pool need to be checked upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

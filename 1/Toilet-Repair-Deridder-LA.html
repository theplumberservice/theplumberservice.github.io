<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Deridder LA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

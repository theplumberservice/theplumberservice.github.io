<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

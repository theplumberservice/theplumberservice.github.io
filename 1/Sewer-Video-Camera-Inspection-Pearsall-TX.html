<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

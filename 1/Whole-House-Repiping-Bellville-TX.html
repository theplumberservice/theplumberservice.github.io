It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

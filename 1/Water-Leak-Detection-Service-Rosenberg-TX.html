<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are extremely important to developing a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a building these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

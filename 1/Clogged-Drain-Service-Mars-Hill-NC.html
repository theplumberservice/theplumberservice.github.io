<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Mars Hill NC</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.

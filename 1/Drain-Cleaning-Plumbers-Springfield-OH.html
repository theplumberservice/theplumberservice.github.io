I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>

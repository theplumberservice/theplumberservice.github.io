Water softeners generally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most typical plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

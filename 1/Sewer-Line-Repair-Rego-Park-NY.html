<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

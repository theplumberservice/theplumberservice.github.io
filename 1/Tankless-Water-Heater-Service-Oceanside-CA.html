<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing.

Depending upon the scope of work being carried out and the type of structure, you might have one or more inspections.</p>

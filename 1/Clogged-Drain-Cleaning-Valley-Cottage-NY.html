<p>Gas lines are essential for homes: they power stoves, hot water heater, and other appliances to keep you dry, warm, and comfy all year long. However, your gas line also carries naturally unstable elements that can be harmful if not handled appropriately. Time and utilize rust gas lines, making them more prone to breaks and fractures.

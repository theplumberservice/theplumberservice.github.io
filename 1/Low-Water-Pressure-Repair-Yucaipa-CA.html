I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

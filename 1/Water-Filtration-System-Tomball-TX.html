<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, consisting of bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save money. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, indicating that difficulty could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>

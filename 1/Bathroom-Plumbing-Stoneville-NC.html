<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You must also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

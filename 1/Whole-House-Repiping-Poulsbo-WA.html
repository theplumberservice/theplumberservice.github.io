<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

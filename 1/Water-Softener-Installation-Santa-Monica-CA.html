<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>

A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in individual homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>

Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>In many cases, a gas line may be covered if it is burst. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line, this type of circumstance might happen.

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

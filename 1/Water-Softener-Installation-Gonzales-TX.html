<p>Numerous house owners think their energy companies or homeowners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in a lot of cases you, the homeowner, are accountable. The majority of standard house owners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your home.</p>

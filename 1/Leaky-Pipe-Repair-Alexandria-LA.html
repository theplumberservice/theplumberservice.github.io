<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a new or remodelled structure is installed by experienced artisans in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a component can cause harmful damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

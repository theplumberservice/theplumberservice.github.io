<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly need to be tested to determine what is in need of repair. The field test may not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair package are required.

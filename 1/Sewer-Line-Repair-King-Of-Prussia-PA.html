<h3>Tankless Hot Water Systems in King Of Prussia Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

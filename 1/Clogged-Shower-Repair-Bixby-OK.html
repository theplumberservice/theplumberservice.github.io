<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Bixby OK</h3>
<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>

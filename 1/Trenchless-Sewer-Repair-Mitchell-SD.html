<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However discovering the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

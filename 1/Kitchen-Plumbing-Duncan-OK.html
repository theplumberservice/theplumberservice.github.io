<p>There's an excellent opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This deterioration can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause typical flow to reverse, backpressure takes place.

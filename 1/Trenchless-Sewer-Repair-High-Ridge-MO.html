<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>For nonemergency jobs-- a remodel or restorative work on your plumbing-- you need a pro who comprehends residential-system design and knows the code in your area. He also needs to be able to operate in a completed environment. That implies putting down a piece of scrap carpets to protect floorings and cutting accurate, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, just when required.</p>

In potable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic locations with destructive water pollutants.</p>

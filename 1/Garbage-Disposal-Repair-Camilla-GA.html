<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC focuses on the installation and repair of residential and commercial natural gas and lp gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services. If your commercial residential or commercial property already has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it tested each year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will notify you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

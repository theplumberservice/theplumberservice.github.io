<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

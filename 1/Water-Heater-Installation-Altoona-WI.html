<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Given that 1980, backflow preventers have been legally mandated for specific buildings by the New York Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York. The regulation was not strictly enforced up until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that consists of routine random inspections of New york city City buildings to make sure they are in compliance.</p>

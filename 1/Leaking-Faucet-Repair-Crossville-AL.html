<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility includes some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional expenses. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or discolored water, it usually signifies rust and mineral buildup.

<p>Galvanized metal, is simply an easier way of saying zinc layered" and what triggers galvanized pipes to corrode is the exposure to excessive water and minerals. You might be believing that it doesn't make good sense to use a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be proper.

If you want to put brand-new pipes in your home or you're constructing a house, there are three types of new plumbing pipe offered that are building-code approved for houses-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional alternatives to the expensive copper piping.</p>

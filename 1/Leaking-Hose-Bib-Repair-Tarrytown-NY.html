<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>

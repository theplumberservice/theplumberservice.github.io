<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait till after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

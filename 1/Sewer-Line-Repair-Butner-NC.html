It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.

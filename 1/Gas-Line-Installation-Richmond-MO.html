<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

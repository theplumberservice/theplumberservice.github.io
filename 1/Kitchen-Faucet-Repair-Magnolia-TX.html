<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Magnolia TX 77354</h3>
<p>Water temperature concerns can be fixed by changing the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>

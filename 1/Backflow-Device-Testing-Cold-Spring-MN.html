<p>House owners typically ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric unit is more cost-effective. The response depends upon your home. While gas models are less costly to operate, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electrical water heater is typically lower, but it can be more pricey to run. Electric ranges are likewise much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>

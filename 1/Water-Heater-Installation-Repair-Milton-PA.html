<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Milton PA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the building is deemed to not present a danger to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

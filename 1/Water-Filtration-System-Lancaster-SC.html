<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

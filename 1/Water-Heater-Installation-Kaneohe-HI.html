<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically found before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This little hole enables water to continually leak out extremely slowly. Over time it can result in a substantial construct of water.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>

<p>In this situation, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

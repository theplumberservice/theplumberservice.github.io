Water pressure might be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

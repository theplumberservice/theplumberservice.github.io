<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system supplying the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then get in the drinkable water system.

The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

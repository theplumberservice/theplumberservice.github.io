<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

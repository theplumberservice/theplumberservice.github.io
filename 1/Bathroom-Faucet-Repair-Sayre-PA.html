<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires precisely, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>

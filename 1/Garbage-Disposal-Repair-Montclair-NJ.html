Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's aspects can trigger the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust, demand that a new one be installed.</p>

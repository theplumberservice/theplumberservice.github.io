Your toilet might end up being stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you could have a house-wide backup triggered by sewage coming back up through the pipes.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you ought to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Old, used, or harmed plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even small leaks can slowly dampen walls and floorings till they become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and include rust to the supply of water. Gurgling sound from pipes. An unusual, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good sign. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>

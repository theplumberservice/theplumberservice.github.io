<p>While not every state requires insurance coverage prior to contractor licenses are released, having your own warranties the safety of your business. Unwanted situations and unforeseen events may occur anytime and being unprepared can put your company in big financial trouble. To be safe instead of sorry, getting the right insurance coverage for your plumbing company functions as a defense versus financial threats and business jeopardies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

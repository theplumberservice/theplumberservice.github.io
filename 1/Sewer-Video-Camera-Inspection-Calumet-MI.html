<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Calumet MI</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

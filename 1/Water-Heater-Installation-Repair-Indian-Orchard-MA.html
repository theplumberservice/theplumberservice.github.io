It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>

<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>

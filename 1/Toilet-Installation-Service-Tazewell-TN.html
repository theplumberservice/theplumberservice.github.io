Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>

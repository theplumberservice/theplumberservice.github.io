<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job since of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust, request that a new one be installed.</p>

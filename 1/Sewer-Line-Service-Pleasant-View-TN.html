<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

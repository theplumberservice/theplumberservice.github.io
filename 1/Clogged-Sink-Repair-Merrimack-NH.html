<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main concerns that you need to ask yourself.

If your home was developed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, opportunities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimal rates.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

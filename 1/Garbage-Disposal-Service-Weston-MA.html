<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and might in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a harmless germs that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to among the other 2 types of salts. Once the new salt has had a chance to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a blockage. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate option to do just that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>

<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>

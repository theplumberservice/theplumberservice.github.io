A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye.

Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may likewise need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>

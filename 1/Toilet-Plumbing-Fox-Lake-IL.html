<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

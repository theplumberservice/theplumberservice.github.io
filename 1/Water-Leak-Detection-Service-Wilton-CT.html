<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>

<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>

<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or organisation, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a larger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally however you can normally flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom.

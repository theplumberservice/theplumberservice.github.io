<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are interesting in securing individuals's lives and to a lower extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source readily available to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result suggest that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high threat protection level.</p>

There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>

<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more vulnerable and fragile to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to rust and rust while some are unaffected. Particular pipe products have higher coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and pressures as an outcome of temperature change and ice development. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

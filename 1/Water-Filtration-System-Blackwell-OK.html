At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Forest, CA homeowners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>

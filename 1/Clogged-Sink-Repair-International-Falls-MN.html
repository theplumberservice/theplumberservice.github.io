<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70.

<p>Although it may be appealing to pour in over-the-counter drain-clearing items, lots of plumbers encourage against it. Not just are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they might also damage drain pipes if excessive used. There are additional concerns that may turn up, which is why our skilled plumbers will carry out a thorough inspection of your unit to determine what has actually caused it to malfunction. From there we can make an informed decision on whether your problem can be resolved by a basic repair or if replacing the waste disposal unit is eventually the much better choice.</p>

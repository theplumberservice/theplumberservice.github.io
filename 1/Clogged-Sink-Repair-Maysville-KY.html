<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Wingate NC</h3>
<p>Contrary to what lots of believe, having a waste disposal unit actually protects your pipes and extends their life-span. Food cleaned down a drain unintentionally or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing obstructions and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a garbage disposal wash directly down quickly.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed before the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and rotted over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger significant leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be replaced.</p>

<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water hardness if you don't see limescale build-up however instead see soap scum, your washing cleaning agents not working as effectively or your skin getting sensitive and itchy. If you smell gas, do not attempt to locate the leak. Instead, leave your home or building right now. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a stimulate. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe location.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation.

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

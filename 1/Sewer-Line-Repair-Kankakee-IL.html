<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical life expectancy computation presumes normal wear and tear of the unit. The life expectancy of a garbage disposal may be lower in the case of overlook, overuse, and abuse of the disposal system. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation? Have a drain connection or other issue that calls for a kitchen or bathroom sink repair? Our plumbing services are prepared for both residential and commercial requirements-- laundry rooms, cooking areas, and restrooms in addition to a public lavatory, wash, janitorial, and preparation sinks.</p>

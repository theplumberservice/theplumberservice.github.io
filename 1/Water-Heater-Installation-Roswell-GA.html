<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Roswell GA</h3>
<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

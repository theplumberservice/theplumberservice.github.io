<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.

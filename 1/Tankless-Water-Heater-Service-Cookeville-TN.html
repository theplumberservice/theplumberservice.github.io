<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider. A totally various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink.

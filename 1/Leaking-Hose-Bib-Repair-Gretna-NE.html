The brand-new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are eliminated to connect the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the type of structure, you might have several inspections.</p>
<p>Often brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl.

Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>As soon as per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running smoothly, we recommend that property owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.

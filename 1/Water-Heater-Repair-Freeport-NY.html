<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

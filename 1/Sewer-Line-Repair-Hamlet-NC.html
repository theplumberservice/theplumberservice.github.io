<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Co2 will possibly contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive.

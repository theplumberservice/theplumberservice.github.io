Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

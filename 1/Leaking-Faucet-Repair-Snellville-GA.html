<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task since of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

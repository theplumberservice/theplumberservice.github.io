<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the home, enabling it to flow backwards into city water products.</p>
<p>Backpressure takes place when the pressure in a personal water supply goes beyond the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can cause typical circulation to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>

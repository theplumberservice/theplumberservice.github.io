All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate kind of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see area below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly needs to satisfy the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be stopped until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>

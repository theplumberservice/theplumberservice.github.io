<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>

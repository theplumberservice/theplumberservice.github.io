Instead of needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it might possibly wind up in a land fill, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into tiny particles that can be flushed to the sewage-disposal tank or sewer.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, but its high cost makes it impractical as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in many cases, include phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>

<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Believe about going tankless if you are considering installing a new water heater. Waste disposal unit should use a grounded outlet for power. One can be added for around $120 if you do not have one currently set up close by.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

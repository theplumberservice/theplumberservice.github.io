<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique possibly attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not do the trick then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the directions and security warnings first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's readily available at many hardware stores.</p>

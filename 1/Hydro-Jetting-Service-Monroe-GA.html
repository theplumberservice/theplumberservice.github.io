<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Monroe</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

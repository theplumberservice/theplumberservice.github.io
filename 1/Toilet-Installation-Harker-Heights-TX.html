<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Harker Heights TX</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

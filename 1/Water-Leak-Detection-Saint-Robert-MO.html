<p>Before the repair technician starts the repair procedure, he must make sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. Correct security precautions should be followed for proper entry if the area is thought about a restricted space. A proper and safe  workplace may entail the positioning of safety barriers or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair service technician or the general public around your workspace are not hurt. If the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area, this might impact the technician's ability to effectively complete the repair.</p>

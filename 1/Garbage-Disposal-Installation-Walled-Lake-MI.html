I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Decatur</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractors in Avon</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

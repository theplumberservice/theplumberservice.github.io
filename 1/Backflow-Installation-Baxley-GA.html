<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>

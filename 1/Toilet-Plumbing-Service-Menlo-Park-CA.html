<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>

<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of blockages in component branches; the repairing of incidental leaks in fixtures, valves or pipes; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing appliances, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; offered that such repairs do not involve or require the replacement of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. If your toilet is fairly brand-new, you may need to switch toilet tissue or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Check the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand and design of your toilet. The trademark name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can become an experimental procedure. Even professional plumbers often try two or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>

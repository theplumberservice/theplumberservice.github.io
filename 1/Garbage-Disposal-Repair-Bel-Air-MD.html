<p>The very best method to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it enters the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as fixtures in the home will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

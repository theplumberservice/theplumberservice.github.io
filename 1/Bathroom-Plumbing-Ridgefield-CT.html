The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively easy system, regardless of their importance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the watering line within your business, where irrigation meets the main water system. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

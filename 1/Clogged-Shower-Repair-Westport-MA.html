<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>One common method for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in individual houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>Community - Hard water can trigger an absence of suds development when soap is agitated in water and cause the development of lime scale in water heaters. Your water is red or brown. Some kinds of pipes can rust over time. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a brown or reddish color.

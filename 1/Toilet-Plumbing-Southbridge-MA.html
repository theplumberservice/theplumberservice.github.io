<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

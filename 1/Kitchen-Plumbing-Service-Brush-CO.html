<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Brush CO 80723?</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that originate inside the home. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root invasion.

The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may carry unclean water or other, harmful substances into the general public water supply and personal plumbing.

Backflow can likewise bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

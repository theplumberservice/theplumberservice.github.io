<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To prevent this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

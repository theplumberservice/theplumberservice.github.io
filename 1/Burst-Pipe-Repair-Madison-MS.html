Water softeners generally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from liquified salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

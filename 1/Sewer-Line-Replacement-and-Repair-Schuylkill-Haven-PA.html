<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it usually succumbs to deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement.

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Schuylkill Haven PA</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

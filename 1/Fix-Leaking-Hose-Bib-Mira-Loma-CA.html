<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible concern with the hot water heater. It can likewise mean the water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old.

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

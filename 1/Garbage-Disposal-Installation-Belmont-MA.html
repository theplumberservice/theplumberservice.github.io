<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

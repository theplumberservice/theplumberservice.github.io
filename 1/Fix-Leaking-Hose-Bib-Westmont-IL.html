<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>

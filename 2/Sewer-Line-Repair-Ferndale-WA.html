<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Ferndale WA</h3>
<p>Defective plumbing and fixtures can be more than a nuisance: It can cost you cash in increased water costs and cause structural damage to your home. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Epa. Fixing those leakages can save you 10 percent on your water costs each year.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, usually salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a very percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

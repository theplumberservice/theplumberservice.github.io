If the line has to do with 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate choice to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>

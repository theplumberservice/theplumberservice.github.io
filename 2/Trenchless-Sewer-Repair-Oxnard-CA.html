<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions guarantee the security, security and consistent efficiency of research study, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. Examining the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be major problem. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house must have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if everything is working appropriately.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

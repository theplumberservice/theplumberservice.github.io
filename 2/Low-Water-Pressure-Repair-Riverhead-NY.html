<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indication of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is very important that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your home. Raw sewage is extremely hazardous and can pose serious health threats.</p>

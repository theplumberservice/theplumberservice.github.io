Which is why selecting a comfy, well-crafted toilet seat is incredibly essential. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience.

It really isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>

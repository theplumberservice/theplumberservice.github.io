Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

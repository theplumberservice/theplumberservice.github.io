<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, dangerous compounds into the public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of scenarios that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City supply of water lines.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

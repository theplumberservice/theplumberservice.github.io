<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped in between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water before causing a clog. Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can happen.

Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the biggest indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio water heater. You might have sediment that has built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower. If your water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to seek advice from the specialists.</p>

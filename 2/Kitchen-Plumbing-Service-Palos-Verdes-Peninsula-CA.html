<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Palos Verdes Peninsula CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

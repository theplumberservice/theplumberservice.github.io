<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

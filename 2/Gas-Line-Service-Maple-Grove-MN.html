<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Maple Grove MN</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly preserved. Making sure the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and aid ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

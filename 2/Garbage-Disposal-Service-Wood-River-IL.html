<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be reliable in avoiding scale formation in tough water supply. It is really hard to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well sufficient described to allow others to examine them and to verify the results.

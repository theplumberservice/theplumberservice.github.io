<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Niles IL</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner.

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's likewise an issue for the environment.

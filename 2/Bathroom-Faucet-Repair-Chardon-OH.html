The study consisted of tests that eliminated challenging soils, in addition to assessing recording and finding. Scientists discovered that softened water uses nearly 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. That detergent savings rises to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regeneration.</p>

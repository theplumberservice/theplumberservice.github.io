<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Tobyhanna</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Homeowners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is particularly prudent to organize inspections on an annual basis and when buying a new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running efficiently. Enzymes are germs that eat raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This natural option is effective and safe. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is fairly new.

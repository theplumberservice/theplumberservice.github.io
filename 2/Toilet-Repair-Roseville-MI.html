<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can become rusty and worn, resulting in leakages. Depending upon the intensity of the circumstance, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and replaced. Components involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>With storage tank warm water heaters, you have a considerable reservoir that holds and heats up water. The heating aspect can be by means of using oil, electricity, or gas. The gas water heaters use natural gas or LPG to heat up the water. The gas designs are also less expensive to run than the electrical types and are a preferred for residential and commercial purposes. When it comes to the advantages of electric tank water heaters, they are much safer and easier to keep compared to their gas counterparts.</p>

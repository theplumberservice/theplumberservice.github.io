<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller model that ran on the very same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>

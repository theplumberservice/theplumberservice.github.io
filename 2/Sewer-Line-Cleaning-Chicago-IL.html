The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome.

During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).

<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>

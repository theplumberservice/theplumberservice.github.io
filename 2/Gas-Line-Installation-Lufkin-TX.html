Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.

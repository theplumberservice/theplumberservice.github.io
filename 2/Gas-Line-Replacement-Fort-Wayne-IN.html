<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Fort Wayne IN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

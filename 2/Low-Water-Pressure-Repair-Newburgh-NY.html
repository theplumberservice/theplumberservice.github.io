With toilets, the pro will check water levels, flappers, and filler systems. He or she will eyeball visible pipes, and might run a camera inspection to check the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner.

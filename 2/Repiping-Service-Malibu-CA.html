Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that gets in touch with the watering line within your company, where irrigation meets the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep track of the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

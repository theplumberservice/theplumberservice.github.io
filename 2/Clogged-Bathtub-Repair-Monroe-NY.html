<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

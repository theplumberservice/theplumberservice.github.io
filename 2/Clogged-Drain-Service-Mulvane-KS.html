<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>The installation of plumbing systems are managed by qualified public authorities that specify the requirements for its design, composition and management, and the training and practices of the plumbers and operators who construct and preserve the systems. Having the drain back up or the nasty odor of a malfunctioning sewer drain in your home is more than a trouble, it makes whatever else stop. When this happens you need a plumbing company that can get there quick. Recognize the complete magnitude of the issue, and fix it quick.</p>

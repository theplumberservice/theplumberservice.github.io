<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't demand repairing the whole toilet. Like any house device, a toilet tank includes lots of little moving parts that might need changed with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

With well water, these signs may also be paired with iron stains and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>

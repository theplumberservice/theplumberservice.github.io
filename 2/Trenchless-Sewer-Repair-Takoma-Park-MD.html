Our energy expenses are much lower then before, the airflow is almost undetectable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures considering that installation.</p>

I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70.

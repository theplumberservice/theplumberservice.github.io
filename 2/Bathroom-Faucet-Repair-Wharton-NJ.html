<p>Irrigation backflow gadgets are developed for installation on drinkable water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the safe and clean water supply.

<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

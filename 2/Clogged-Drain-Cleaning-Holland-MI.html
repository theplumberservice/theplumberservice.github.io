<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.

<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building of a brand-new or refurbished structure is installed by experienced artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can trigger harmful damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

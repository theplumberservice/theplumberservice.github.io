Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you ought to wait until after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings.

<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

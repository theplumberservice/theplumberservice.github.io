<p>Our group at All Stage Plumbing also uses drain cleaning innovation to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a outstanding and resilient  alternative for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process includes our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is totally saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to solidify in location for numerous hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

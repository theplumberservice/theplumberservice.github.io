<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply.

Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

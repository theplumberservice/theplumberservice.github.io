<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the buildup of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that accumulates inside of pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes effectively.

Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

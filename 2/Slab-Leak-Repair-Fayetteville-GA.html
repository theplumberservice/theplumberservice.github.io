A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a risk to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

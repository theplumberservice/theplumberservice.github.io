<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

Gently bend the float arm to put additional pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Picture 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works.

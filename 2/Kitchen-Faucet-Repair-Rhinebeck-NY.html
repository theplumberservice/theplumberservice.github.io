<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

But while small drips must not be cause for concern, homeowners need to watch on the hot water heater leakages.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

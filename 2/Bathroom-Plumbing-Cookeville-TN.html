<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>If you are aiming to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak, very first consider your choices. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be required. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near extensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of collateral damage (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Idea: Check with local codes prior to trying to install a waste disposal unit. Some communities have plumbing codes that do not permit disposals since of limits on sewer capacity. They might also need an air space if the disposal is used with a dishwasher.

We provide affordable Orange County hot water heater replacements and repairs to consumers throughout the area.

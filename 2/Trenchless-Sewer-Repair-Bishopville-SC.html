First, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to 3 weeks or more to process and approve. Rejected plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>

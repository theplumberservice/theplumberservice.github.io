<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Garden City MI</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But discovering the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>

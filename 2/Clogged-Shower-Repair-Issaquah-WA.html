Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

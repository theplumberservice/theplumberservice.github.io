<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 available methods. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs gradually. Sanford & Son plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas.

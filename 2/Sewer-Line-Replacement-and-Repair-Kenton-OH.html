<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Kenton OH</h3>
<p>Faulty plumbing and fixtures can be more than a problem: It can cost you cash in increased water bills and cause structural damage to your home. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leaks in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Epa. Repairing those leakages can save you 10 percent on your water bills each year.</p>

Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a very percentage of salt to your water.

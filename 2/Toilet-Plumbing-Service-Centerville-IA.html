<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

Prior to installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>

I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

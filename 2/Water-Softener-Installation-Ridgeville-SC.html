Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight evenly and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>

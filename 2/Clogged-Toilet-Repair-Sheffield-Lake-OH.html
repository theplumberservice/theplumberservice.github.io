<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>You might be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save money. While this may operate in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, indicating that trouble might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system.

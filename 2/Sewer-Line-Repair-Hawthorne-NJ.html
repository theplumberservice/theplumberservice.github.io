<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Hawthorne NJ 07506</h3>
<p>If you've always lived in an area with tough water, you may not realize just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

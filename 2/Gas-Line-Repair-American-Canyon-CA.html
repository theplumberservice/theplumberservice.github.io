<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively.

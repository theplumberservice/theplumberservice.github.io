<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to permit the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>

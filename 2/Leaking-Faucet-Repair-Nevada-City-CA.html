<p>After the pipe is cleaned up, we move to employ our repairs as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we insert into the sewer line is able to pump up in order to use the epoxy resin. The resin is provided a few hours to fully solidify and treat, and after the sewer pipe line repair procedure is completed, our customers are supplied with a new sewer line that will add to the overall quality of the sewer system for several years.

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

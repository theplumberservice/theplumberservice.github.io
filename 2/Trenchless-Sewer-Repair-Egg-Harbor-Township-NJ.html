<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

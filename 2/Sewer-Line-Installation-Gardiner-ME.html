<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

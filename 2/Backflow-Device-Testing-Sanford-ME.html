Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is only equipped to deal with softer organic waste.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

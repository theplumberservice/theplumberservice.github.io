<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Morristown NJ</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

This water is being disposed down the overflow tube squandering approximately 200 gallons of water each day. That takes a toll on your water bill, not to mention the risk of a more serious leak that might wreak havoc on your home with flooding.</p>

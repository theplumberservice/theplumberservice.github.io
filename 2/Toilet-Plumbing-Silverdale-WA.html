<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to consider the age of your system. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's typically not a good idea to spend for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the cost of a new system. If problems end up being more frequent with an older system, then it is advised that you have the waste disposal unit replaced. We provide a number of affordable and highly effective systems, and supply in advance pricing prior to work begins so there are no surprises. It is our goal to offer all of our valued consumers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding areas the service they need at a cost they can manage.</p>
<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals understands this mistake: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently utilized and you've replaced the flapper, the problem might be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its ability to seal properly, developing waste and a greater water bill.</p>

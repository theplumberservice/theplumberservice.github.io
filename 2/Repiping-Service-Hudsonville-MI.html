When hard-water scale is already present, Rust can still happen under conditions that are favorable to the development of hard-water scale or even.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.

Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the daily expenditures and disappointments sustained by difficult water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will conserve you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably exceeded by the money and energy conserved.</p>

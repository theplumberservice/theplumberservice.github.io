<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for typical home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned prior to it leads to further damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>

<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

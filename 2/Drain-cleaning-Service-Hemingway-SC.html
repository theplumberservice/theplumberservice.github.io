<p>In truth, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves behind. In time these deposits can collect, clog, or even wear away pipes and cause significant plumbing problems.

<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or long-term connection in between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>

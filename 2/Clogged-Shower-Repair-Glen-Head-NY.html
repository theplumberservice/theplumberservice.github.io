<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>

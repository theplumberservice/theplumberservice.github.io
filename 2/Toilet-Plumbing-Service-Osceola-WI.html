<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.

<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

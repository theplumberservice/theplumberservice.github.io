<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Springfield VT</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

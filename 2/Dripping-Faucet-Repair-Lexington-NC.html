If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

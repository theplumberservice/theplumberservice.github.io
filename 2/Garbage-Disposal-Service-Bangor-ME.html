<h3>Drain Maintenance in Bangor Maine</h2>
<p>A leaking toilet can lose water and cause water damage, and a running toilet wastes as much as 7,500 gallons of water each year, causing water expenses to increase.

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet ought to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>

<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

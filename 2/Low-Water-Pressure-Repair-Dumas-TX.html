<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of trash does not need to enter the garbage can if it can quickly and rapidly be dealt with through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other disposing areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>

<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Examine Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>

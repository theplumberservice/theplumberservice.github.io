<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Berlin WI</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>

Houses built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or blemished water, it usually signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>

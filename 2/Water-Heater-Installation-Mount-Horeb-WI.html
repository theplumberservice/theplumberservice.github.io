<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

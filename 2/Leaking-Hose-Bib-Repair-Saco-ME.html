A sinkhole can form, making it needed to cordon off that part of your lawn. The situation is laden with problems because the swampiness will attract unwanted creatures. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted effectively (Image 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>

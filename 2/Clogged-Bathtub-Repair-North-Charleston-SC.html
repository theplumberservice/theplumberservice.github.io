<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services North Charleston SC</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>

The first step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and then instantly check the drain. In many cases a smoke test can be carried out to expose breaks or fractures. ZOOM DRAIN performs a complimentary peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at.

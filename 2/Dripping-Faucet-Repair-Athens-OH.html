As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, temperature level or quality can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance.

<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes.

<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. The pipes frequently make unusual gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

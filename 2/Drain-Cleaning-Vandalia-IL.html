<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating component is taking longer to heat up the water than it should. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The factors for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is among the pointed out issues, a repair or replacement of the elements might suffice. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>

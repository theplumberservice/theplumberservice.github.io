When you're all set to in fact install your waste disposal unit, follow these actions below thanks to Lowe's task professional, Hunter Macfarlane. As you read through these steps, if anything provides you pause, feel free to hire a pro. There's no shame in getting a little help when you need it.</p>

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Running out of warm water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually transported elsewhere to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

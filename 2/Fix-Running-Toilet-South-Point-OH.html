<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

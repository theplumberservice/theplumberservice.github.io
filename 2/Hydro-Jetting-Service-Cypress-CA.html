<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

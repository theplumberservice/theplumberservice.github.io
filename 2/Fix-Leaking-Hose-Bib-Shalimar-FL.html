<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. When this happens, it generally suggests wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up.

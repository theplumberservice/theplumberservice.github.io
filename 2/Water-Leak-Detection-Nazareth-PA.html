The gas water heaters make use of natural gas or LPG to heat the water.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy.

Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

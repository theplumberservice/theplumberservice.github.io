<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.

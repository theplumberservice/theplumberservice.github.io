<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

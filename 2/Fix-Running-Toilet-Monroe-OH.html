<p>If you have a septic system, then you may wrongly believe that you can not have a waste disposal unit, and this is not real. Nevertheless, house owners with waste disposal unit and septic systems may have to pump their septic more frequently.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

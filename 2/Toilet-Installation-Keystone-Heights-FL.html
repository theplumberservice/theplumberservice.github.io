At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Keystone Heights FL</h3>
<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause significant problems. Even little leaks can slowly dampen walls and floors up until they end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might become rusty and include rust to the water supply. Gurgling sound from pipes. A weird, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good sign. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this issue. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed prior to the 1970s and has not undergone remodeling or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and rotted over the years. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>

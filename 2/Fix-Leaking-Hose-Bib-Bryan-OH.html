Apollo Plumbing Service provides the most professional drain cleaning and maintenance services across Oregon and Washington. Whether it's from the accumulation of grease or particles, our specialists can clear the most tough drain or clog.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>

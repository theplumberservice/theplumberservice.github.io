<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.

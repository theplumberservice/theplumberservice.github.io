As soon as your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to make sure that there are no gas leaks.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

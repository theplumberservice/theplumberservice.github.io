<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Petal MS</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>

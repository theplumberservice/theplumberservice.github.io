<p>Any location water goes through house. This includes sinks, toilets, pipes, lines, and tubs. At this time, the pro will look for leaks and broken pipes or fittings.

<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure permit is generally required before a plumbing license can be provided. Soften just what you need to. Individuals typically select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be linked to a softener.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>

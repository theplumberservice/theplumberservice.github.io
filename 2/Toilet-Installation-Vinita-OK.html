<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and circumstances that need backflow prevention devices. For home, it is necessary for owners to signal the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District evaluates using each brand-new tenant. The correction should be made before water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the property or the occupant owner.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

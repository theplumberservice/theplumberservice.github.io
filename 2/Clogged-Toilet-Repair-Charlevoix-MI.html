<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of keeping the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component.

<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can take place gradually from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up inside of pipes. As a clog ends up being larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining properly. You can fight difficult water in numerous ways, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>If you discover low water pressure or tarnished water, it usually signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>

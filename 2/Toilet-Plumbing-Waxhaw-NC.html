<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Waxhaw NC</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>You hear water leaking or running in the tank. When water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow takes place.

<p>Mold Growth: Mold growth is another unfortunate side effect if you need a sewer line fixed. When you also have a smell of sewage along with it, this is most common.

You will most likely see a white residue on your wall close to an area where a sewer pipe lies.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Fda.</p>

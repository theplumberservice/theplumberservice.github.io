<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Marion OH</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

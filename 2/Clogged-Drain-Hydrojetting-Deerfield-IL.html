<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the appropriate preventative measures if using among these items.</p>

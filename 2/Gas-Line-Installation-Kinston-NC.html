The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>

Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule.</p>

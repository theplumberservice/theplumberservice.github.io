Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leakages and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as preferred.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, many drain issues can only be identified once they begin to support. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be performed.

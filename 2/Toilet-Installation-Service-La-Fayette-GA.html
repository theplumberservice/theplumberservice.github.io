<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber La Fayette GA</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

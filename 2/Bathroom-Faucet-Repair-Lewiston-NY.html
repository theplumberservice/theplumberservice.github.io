<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project.

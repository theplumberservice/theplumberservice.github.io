A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not posture a threat to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

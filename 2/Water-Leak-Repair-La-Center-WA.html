<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>If you're considering changing to a tankless hot water heater, it's a good concept to weigh the pros and cons of this sophisticated option.

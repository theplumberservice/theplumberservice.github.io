<p>A continuously running toilet implies your house is wasting water and you're paying greater utility costs than necessary.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning pilot light: This is an issue if you have a gas water heater. If the pilot burner is having trouble staying on, your hot water heater will ultimately stop working.

<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you ought to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

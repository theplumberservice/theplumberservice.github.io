<p>If you discover low water pressure or stained water, it normally represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>

It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be offered.</p>

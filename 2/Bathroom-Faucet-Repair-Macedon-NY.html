<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Because 1998, we have been serving Southern California with industry-leading plumbing services ranging from brand-new and remodel building and construction tasks to installation and repair residential services. A lot of sink clogs that occur are much deeper than you may believe, and the severity is so serious that a normal store-bought drain cleaner or unscripted home drain cleaning remedy can not fix.</p>

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

<p>When looking for a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to use certified and well-trained professionals for all aspects of your plumbing and gas line installation. As soon as your plumber has actually installed a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to ensure that there are no gas leaks. This need to be done before the plumber leaves the task. The audit will minimize the possibilities of a gas leak. If you do see a pungent smell in your house after your plumber leaves, shut off the gas valves right away. Leave the building and make sure that open fire does not get near to your home until a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas utility company immediately.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water supply.

Others might not meet state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>

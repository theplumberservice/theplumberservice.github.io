<p>Lots of house owners think their energy companies or house owners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that oftentimes you, the house owner, are accountable. Most basic homeowners insurance coverage and local utility companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>Other in advance expenses might also be accumulated for a tankless design with elite features and a higher performance grade.

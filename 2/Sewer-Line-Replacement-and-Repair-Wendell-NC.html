Like any other system that receives regular, continuous usage, your house's pipes are subject to regular wear and tear. Ultimately, these pipes will need to be replaced altogether.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

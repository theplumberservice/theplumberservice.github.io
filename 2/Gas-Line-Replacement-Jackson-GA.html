<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which might carry dirty water or other, harmful compounds into the general public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of circumstances that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can likewise bring water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source.

<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are experts in sink repair and are all set to fix your clogged sink or perform a sink installation to meet your requirements. There's typically confusion about whether National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards require backflow preventers on fire protection systems. Let's be clear: they do not. If you have an issue with your garbage disposal or kitchen plumbing, trust the professionals at Patriot Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Inc. and simply call 509-662-6262 today for professional kitchen plumbing services in the Wenatchee, WA area.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

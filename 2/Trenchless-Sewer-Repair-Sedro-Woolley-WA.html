To prevent this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside and underground, DCVs are a little bit more costly but are also highly practical, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically.

You need a professional inspection to accurately detect the problem when you have an issue with your sewer line.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

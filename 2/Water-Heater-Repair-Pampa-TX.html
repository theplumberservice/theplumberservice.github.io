Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

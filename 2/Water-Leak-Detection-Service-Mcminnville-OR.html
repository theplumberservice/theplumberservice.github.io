This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

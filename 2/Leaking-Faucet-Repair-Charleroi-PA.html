<h3>Shower Installation in Charleroi Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you see nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist right and left. If the motor spins easily, check that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button. If these steps don't work, and your disposer's service warranty has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>

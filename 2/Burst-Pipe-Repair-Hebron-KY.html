Which is why choosing a comfy, well-made toilet seat is extremely important. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol.

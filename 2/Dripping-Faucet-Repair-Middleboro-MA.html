Stopping working a checkup can indicate undesirable hold-ups in your task.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or tarnished water, it usually represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop over time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>

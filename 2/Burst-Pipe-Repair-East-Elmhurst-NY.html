<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals.

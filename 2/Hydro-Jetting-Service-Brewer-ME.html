<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

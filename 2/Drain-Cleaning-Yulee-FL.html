For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

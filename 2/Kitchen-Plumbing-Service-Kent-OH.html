Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't an excellent idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been particularly developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>

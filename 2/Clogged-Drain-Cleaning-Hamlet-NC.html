It's time to think about replacing it with a more efficient model if your water heater is more than 10 years old. Water on the floor can mean worn parts. Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenses and disappointments sustained by tough water, a water softener is eventually an investment that will save you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is greatly exceeded by the money and energy saved.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its high cost makes it impractical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, sometimes, include phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>

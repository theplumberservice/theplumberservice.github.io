<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

Also, the BPA must be installed according to the most recent plumbing code adopted by the City of Austin.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Lots of scattering systems already have the proper backflow preventer installed and need only be evaluated yearly. Others might not satisfy state and local guidelines and might need to be changed with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the home, allowing it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>

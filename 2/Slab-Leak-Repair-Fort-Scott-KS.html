<p>There are various causes for obstructions depending on where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from too much bathroom tissue for the a lot of part. When the bathroom tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl. When our plumber has to remove the toilet to unclog the drain properly, there are times.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain because they generally include grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, obstructing them.

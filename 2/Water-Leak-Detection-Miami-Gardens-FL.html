<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the option is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is necessary to fix the problem. Other times a more extensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Among our numerous professional services at Ryan's Plumbing is toilet repair. A clog or leak in a toilet can cause water damage to your house if not fixed rapidly. Doing a toilet repair yourself can be challenging if you aren't well versed in plumbing repair, so we recommend you leave it to Ryan's Plumbing to get your toilet working quickly once again.</p>

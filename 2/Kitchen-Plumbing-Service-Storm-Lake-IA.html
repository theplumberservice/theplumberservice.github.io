<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

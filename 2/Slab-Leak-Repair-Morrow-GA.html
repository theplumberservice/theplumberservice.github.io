<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material utilized in plumbing.

<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair.

And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

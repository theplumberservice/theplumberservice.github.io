<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Moyock NC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

It is quite typical to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is just set up in the course of least resistance. Depending on the design of your home, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>

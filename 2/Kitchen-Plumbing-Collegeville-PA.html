<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Collegeville PA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

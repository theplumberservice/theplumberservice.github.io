<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

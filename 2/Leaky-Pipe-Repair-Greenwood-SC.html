<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

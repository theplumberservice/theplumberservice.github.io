Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage.

It is important that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

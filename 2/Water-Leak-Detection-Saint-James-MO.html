<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

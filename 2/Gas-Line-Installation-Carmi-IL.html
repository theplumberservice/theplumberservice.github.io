<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, prepare for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might take up to 3 weeks or more to approve and process.

<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention.

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

<p>One typical method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread tremendously. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>

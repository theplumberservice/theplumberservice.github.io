<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. This distinct aroma allows you to smell a potential leak if it happens. If you believe a leak, constantly leave.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, typically salt. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a very percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low salt" by the Fda.</p>

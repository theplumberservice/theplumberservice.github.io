This can be tough, since your plumbing system is primarily concealed from sight within walls or crawlspaces. Here's a quick guide of what you must try to find.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

With well water, these signs might also be coupled with iron discolorations and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>

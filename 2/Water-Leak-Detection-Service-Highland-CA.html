<p>Debating whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our specialists will give you a truthful recommendation. In basic, older water heaters (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are much better off being changed. A more recent, more effective hot water heater will conserve you in repair costs and energy over time.

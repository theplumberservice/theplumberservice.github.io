It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

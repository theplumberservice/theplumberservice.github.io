<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

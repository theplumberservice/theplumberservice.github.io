<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for locals. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>

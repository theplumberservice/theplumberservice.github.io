<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Setting up gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water adhere to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must satisfy or exceed the state standards and carry the responsibility for implementing them.</p>

As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>With tank warm water heaters, you have a large tank that warms and holds water. The heating aspect can be via using gas, oil, or electricity. The gas hot water heater use gas or LPG to heat up the water. The gas models are likewise cheaper to run than the electrical types and are a preferred for commercial and residential purposes.

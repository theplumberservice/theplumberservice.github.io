<p>If you have a septic tank, then you may mistakenly believe that you can not have a waste disposal unit, and this is not real. However, house owners with garbage disposals and septic systems may have to pump their septic regularly.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>There are two broad classifications of sources of possible cross contamination: external and internal. Internal sources include the previously mentioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and home appliances such as meal washers, warm water tanks, glowing water heating systems, etc. External sources consist of rain water run-off from roofing systems and parking area, groundwater, puddles of surface water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other supply of water pipelines, septic tanks, underground tank and cisterns, watering pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, sprinkler system, agricultural run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost heap, buried or aboveground chemical tank, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewers throughout heavy rainfall occasions into building structures and basements.</p>

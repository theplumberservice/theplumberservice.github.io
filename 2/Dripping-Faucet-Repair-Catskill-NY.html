<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

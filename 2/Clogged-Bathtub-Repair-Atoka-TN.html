<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>

Sewer pipes can be infamously tough to trace, especially on older properties, so you'll wish to employ someone who will trace the problem at its source.</p>

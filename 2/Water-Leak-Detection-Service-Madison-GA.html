<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

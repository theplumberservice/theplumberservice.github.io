All replacements need to be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see area listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly should meet the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be discontinued until the assembly is in compliance.</p>

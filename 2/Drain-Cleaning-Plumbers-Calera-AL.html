<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

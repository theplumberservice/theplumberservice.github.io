<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally channelled elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be vulnerable to clogging due to the fact that there simply isn't enough a high enough flow to flush out the debris.</p>

<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis.

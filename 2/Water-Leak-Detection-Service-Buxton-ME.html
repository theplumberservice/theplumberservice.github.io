<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

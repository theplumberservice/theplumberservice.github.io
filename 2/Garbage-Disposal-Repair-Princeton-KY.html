Chicago Gas Lines focuses on natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for locals.

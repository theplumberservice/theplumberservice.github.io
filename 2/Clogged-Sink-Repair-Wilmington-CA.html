<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You ought to also examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

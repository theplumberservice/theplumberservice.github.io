Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

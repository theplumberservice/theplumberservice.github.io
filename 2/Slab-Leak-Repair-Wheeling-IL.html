<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

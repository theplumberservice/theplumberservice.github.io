For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backward into city water supplies.</p>
<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Inspect prevents backflow brought on by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.

<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to conduct website inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a real or possible  cross-connection hazard on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are just carried out on Wednesdays.

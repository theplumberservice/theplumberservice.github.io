A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken.

The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>

<p>A normal whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days, depending upon the size of the home, the number of levels it has actually and the picked pipe product.

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>

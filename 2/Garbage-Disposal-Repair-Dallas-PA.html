<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Dallas PA 18612</h3>
<p>A kitchen sink repair is a common problem in many residential houses. It is one of the most pre-owned plumbing fixture that with time if not taken care of might trigger a huge problem at the owners cost. As seen on the above image, there are lots of parts to a kitchen sink. A kitchen sink repair might be as basic as altering a shut off valve or as complicated as fixing the drain assembly to your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>

There are so many types of piping systems and conditions, it's an excellent concept to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>

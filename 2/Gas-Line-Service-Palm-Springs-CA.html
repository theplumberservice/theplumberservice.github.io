It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be supplied.</p>

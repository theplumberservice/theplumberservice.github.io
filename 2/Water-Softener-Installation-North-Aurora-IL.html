Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is incredibly essential. Nevertheless, you need to ensure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem.

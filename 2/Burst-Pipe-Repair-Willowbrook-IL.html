<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

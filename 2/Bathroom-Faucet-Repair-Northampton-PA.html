<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Lots of toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, do not require fixing the whole toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of little moving parts that may need changed with usage gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

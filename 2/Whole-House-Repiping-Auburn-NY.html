The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

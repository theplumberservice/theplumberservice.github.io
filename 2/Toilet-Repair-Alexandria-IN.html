<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

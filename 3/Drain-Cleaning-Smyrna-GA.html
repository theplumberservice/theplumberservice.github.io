<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>The installation of plumbing systems are overseen by qualified public authorities that specify the requirements for its management, composition and style, and the training and practices of the operators and plumbers who build and keep the systems.

When this happens you need a plumbing company that can get there fast. Identify the full magnitude of the issue, and fix it fast.</p>

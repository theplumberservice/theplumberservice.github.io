<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>If you see nothing apparent, insert the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the system, and twist right and left. Inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button if the motor spins easily. If these measures do not work, and your disposer's service warranty has actually expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>A well-trained plumber would not advise a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that is the case they may suggest moving toilets to different bathrooms to minimize any future stoppages.

<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>We have 2 no-dig approaches to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We total CIPP repairs with no excavation. Pipe rupturing needs restricted digging. Both techniques are ending up being more popular with our clients, however many people aren't familiar with these trenchless techniques.

The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations.

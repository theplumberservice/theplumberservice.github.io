<p>Before the repair technician starts the repair process, he should make sure he has assessed the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. If the area is considered a restricted area, proper security preventative measures need to be followed for correct entry. A safe and appropriate workplace might entail the placement of security barricades or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair specialist or the public around your work area are not damaged.

A clogged kitchen sink is generally an indication of a clog in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't eliminated, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually causing it to burst.</p>

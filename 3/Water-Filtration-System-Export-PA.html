<h3>Plumbing Camera Inspections in Export Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. A number of houses in my neighborhood being repiped and have spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause significant damage if the leak isn't discovered quickly.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain specialist to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line.

In some circumstances, resins can not be cleaned of contaminants and will need to be changed. (This need to not hold true if the resin is regularly regenerated and preserved.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>

<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>

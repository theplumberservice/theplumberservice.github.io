<p>Homeowners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient. The answer depends upon your house. While gas designs are less costly to operate, they do need an existing gas line. The cost of an electrical water heater is typically lower, but it can be more pricey to operate. Electric varieties are also simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the cost savings have been based largely on minimizing chemical and detergent costs.

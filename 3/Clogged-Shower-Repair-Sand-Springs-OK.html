<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a really small amount of sodium to your water.

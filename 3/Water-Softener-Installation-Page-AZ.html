<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

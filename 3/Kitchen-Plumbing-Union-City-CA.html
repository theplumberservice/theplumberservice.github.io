<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or company, and its capability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this could be an indication of a larger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can generally flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small blockages can become big ones relatively quickly.</p>

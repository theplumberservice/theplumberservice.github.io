<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products including severe chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Water softening shower heads can deliver the very same advantages as a water softening system. You'll be able to get rid of soap and hair shampoo without leaving any residue, leaving you with healthier hair and smoother skin. There are lots of water softening shower heads offered, so you can easily find one that will suit your existing shower.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection in between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>

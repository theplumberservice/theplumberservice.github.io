Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

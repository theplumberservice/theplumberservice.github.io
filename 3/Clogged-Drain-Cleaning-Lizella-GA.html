<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>

<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Kingston WA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is merely the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, many times in concrete. It is quite typical to leave the old pipes in place after disconnecting them. The new pipe is just installed in the path of least resistance. Depending on the design of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait till after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

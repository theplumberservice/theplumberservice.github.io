<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, in spite of their significance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the watering line within your business, where irrigation fulfills the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

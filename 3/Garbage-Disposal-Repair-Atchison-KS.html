<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>

Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.

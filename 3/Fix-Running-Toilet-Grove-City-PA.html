<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

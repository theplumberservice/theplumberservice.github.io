<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for homeowners.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

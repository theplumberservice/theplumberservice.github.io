<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

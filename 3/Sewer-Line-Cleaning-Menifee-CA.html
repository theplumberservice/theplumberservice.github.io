Like any other system that gets frequent, continuous usage, your home's pipes go through regular wear and tear. Ultimately, these pipes will need to be changed entirely. However, due to the fact that they are hidden underground, behind walls, and tucked out of sight, it isn't always easy to inform when you need repiping.</p>

If you're converting your home to natural gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more.

Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>

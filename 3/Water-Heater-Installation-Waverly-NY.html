<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

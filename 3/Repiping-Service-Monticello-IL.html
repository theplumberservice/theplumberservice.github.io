<p>So as you go about your early morning preparing for the day, just know the pipes in your bathroom are already hard at work. That is, of course, unless your bathroom plumbing needs to be repaired.

<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good indication, a strange gurgling sound.

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Normally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>

<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Declined strategies need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>

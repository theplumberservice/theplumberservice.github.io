<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in South Berwick ME 03908</h3>

Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

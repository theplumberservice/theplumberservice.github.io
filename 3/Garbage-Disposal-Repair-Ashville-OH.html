<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a danger to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

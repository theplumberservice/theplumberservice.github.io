<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>

It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should likewise be offered.</p>

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair.

The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

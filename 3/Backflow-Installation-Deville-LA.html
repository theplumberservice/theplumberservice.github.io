Sanford & Kid plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regeneration, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads.

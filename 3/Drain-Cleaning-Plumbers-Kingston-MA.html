All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see area listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly must meet the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be terminated till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

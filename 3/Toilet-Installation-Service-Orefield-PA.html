<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Orefield PA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

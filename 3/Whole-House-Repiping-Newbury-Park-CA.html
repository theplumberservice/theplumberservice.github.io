<p>A lot of Chicago property owners don't consider their sewer and drain lines up until there's a concern. Regrettably, disregarding your plumbing up until problems develop can result in extensive damage and pricey repairs. To prevent the headache of clogged drains, overruning toilets, and backed-up sewer lines, it is necessary to have regular, preventative maintenance carried out by a certified Chicago sewer and drain specialist.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure.

A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

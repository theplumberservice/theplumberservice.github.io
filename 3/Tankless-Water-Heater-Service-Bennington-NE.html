<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system.

<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't require repairing the entire toilet. Like any house device, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that might need replaced with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Hard water causes a greater risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes versus the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>

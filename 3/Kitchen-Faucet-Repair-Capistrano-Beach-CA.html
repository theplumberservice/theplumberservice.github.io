<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Capistrano Beach CA</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

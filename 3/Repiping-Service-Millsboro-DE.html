<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

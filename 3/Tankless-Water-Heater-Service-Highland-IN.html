The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

It is rather common to leave the old pipes in place after detaching them. The brand-new pipe is simply set up in the path of least resistance. Depending upon the design of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Many softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

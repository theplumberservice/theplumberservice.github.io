<p>To identify if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black).

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is far more reliable at getting rid of blockages. Many houses have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older houses without cleanouts. A professional plumber can include cleanouts to your house if you are having drain problems.</p>

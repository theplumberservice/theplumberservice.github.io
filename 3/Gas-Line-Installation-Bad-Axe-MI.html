<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to only employ a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch wetness so that it does not get in the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more costly to repipe since the plumber will have to navigate through walls to do the job.

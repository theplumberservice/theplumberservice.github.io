<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting near ten years old, it's usually not smart to spend for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the cost of a brand-new unit. If problems end up being more regular with an older system, then it is encouraged that you have the waste disposal unit changed. We provide a variety of extremely effective and affordable systems, and supply upfront rates prior to work begins so there are no surprises. It is our objective to provide all of our valued consumers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding locations the service they need at a rate they can pay for.</p>

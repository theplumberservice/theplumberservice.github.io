Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to likewise be supplied.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible concern with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise mean the water heater is near the end of its life.

<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>

<p>The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program established by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program utilizes minor installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing authorizations for particular types of small electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer failed inspection due to excessive plants. Please trim your plants and schedule testing with a company from our certified tester list This need to be completed within 30 days to prevent water service disruption.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of clogging or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to check the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us.

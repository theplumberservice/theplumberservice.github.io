This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.

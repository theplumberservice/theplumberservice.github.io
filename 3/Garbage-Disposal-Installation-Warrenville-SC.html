<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create serious drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>

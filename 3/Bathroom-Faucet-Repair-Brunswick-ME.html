<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Brunswick ME</h3>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Usage of tankless systems in second houses eliminates threats of water damage. Traditional hot water tanks have risk of leaking, which can result in pricey damage repairs, specifically when left unattended. A tankless hot water heater has no risk of leaking a complete tank of water and causing harm. Plumbing and heating problems need to be managed by qualified and experienced specialists, like those on our team.

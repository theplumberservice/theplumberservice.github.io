<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

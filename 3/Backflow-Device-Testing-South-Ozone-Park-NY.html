<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

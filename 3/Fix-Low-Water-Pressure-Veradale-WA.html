There are a couple of things you must know if you are on the fence about purchasing one.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is produced. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible contaminants can then enter the potable water supply. The very best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

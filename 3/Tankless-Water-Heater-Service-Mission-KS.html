<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with hard water, you might not recognize just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water.

Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

<p>Plumbers usually start as apprentices. From there, they evaluate and make a journey plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is often ground zero for blockages. As hair integrates with soap, it can create the perfect storm for plumbing clogs. In time, these blockages can aggravate and prevent your bathtub from draining at all.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>

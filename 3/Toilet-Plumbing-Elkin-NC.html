The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>

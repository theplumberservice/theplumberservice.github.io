Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

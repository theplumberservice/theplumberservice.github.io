<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their workers). The key to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save cash.

Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and avoid bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>

<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates, hardness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

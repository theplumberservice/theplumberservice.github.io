<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

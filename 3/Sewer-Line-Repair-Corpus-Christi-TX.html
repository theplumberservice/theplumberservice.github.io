<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing.

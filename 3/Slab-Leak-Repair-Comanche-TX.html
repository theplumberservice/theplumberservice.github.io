<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be efficient in preventing scale formation in tough water systems. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well adequate explained to allow others to assess them and to verify the outcomes. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it must make one be reluctant to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>

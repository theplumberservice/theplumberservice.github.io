As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

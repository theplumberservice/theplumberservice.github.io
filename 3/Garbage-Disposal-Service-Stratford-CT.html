<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70.

<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by eliminating an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not only dry your skin and hair but also develop in pipes and home appliances minimizing their effectiveness and life span. Your washing water, machine and dishwasher heater are all negatively impacted by difficult water. The results of tough water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your individual look and convenience.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink.

Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned prior to it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your home.</p>

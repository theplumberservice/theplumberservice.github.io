Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water supply within a building these devices are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

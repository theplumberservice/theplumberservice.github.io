AVB's can be plastic or brass and either manual or electrical. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are installed on each zone of the irrigation system, instantly after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

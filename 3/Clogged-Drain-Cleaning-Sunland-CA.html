<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up during construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining component itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face situations, frequently that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. In some cases, the basements are so full of sewage, I can not safely go into the basement and operate until the sewage is extracted and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd love to publish some photos of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

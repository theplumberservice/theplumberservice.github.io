<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of protection for the public water supply system.</p>

<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Maynard MA 01754</h3>
<p>I have been impressed with your company and its individuals from the day your sales individual strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the method, this is a great system. Our energy costs are much lower then in the past, the air flow is virtually unnoticeable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowner install gas lines for gas ranges, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable appliances in the house. Gas lines deliver the natural energy source to the home securely. Gas lines should meet certain requirements to ensure that there are no gas leaks that may be hazardous to the occupants. The professional must ensure that the pipes are designed to properly deliver gas to the home.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or long-term connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>When a plumbing permit has been provided in mistake because of inaccurate, incomplete or inaccurate details, or the work for which the permit was released violates the Uniform Code, such authorization will be withdrawed or suspended until such time as the permit holder demonstrates that all work finished and all work proposed shall be in compliance with applicable arrangements of the code.</p>

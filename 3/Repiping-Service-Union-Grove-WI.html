<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

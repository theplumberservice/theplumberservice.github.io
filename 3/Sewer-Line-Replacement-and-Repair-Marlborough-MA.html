<p>Our plumber groups intend to keep your house and work locations efficient, functional and comfortable. When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to avoid flooding problems.

When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

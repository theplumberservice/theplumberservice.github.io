Tough water interferes with the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

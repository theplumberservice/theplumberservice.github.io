<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must meet or surpass the state standards and carry the responsibility for implementing them.</p>

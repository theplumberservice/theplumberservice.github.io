<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

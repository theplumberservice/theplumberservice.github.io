<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Vandalia OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

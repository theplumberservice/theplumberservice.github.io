<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally unusual cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

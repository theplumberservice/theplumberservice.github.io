<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>As soon as the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>

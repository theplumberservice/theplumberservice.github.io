<h3>Shower Valve Repair in Eldridge Iowa</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard.

Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

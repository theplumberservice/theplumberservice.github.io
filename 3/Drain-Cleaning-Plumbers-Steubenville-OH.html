<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

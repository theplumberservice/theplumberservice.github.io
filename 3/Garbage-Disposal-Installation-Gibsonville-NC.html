<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Nevertheless, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is important to have a licensed and skilled plumber manage the task. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than 30 years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a new home, or just wanting to upgrade your existing toilet, we ensure that our installation process will not harm your home or its plumbing system.</p>

<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective working a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually sodium.

According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Fda.</p>

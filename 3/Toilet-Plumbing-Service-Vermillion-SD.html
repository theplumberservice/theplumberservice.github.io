<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>

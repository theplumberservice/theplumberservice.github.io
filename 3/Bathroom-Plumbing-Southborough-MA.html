<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Southborough MA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

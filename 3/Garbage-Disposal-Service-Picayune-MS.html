<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main product utilized in plumbing.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in 2 standard types - continuous feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the system.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

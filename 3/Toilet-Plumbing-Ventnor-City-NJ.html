Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water system within a building these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

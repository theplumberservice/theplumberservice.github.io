If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

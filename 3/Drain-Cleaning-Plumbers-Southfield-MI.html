<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.

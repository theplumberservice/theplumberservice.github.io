Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.

The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

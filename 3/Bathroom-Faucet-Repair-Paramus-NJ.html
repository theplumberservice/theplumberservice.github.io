<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

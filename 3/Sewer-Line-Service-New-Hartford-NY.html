<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

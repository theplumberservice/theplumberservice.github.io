<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply decades of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.

If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>

During regrowth, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Add more warm water if it slowly recedes as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to attempt a brand-new approach. Tankless systems connect directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is needed. This leads to savings on your energy costs.

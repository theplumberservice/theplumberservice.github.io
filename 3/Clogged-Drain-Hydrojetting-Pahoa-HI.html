<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to go through. The pipes typically make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, leading to the strange noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It usually represents rust and mineral accumulation if you see low water pressure or blemished water.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health danger in your water.</p>

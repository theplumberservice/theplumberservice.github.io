<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

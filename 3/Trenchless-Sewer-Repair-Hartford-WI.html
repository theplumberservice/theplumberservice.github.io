During regeneration, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a potential issue with the water heater. It can also imply the water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years of ages.

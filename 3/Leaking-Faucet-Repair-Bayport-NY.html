<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Bayport NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

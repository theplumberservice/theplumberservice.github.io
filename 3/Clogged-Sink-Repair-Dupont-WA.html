<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water system because it can spread out polluted water back through a circulation system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection in between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable contaminants or contaminants to go into the drinkable water system.

<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing supplied exceptional service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not just was he extensive and exceptionally professional but he was able to respond to all my concerns concerning the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

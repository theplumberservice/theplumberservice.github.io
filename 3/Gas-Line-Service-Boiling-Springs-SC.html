I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>

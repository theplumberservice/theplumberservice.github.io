    <meta name="description" content="Professional Plumber Contractor Von Ormy Texas - Limestone dissolved in water is termed "hardness." Ground water dissolves limestone from deposits formed eons ago through the following steps: a) carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce carbonic acid which in the environment exists primarily as the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-1); b) microscopic marine organisms consume this as carbonate and form calcite skeletons which were deposited over millions of years to form limestone deposits which are found extensively in many parts of the world; c) ground water is often slightly to moderately acidic due to anaerobic decomposition and action of bacteria in the soil.">

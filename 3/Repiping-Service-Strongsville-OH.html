There are a couple of food items you need to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

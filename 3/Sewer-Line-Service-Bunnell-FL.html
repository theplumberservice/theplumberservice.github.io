<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water supply. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

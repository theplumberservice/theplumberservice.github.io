<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest method maybe try utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not work then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the instructions and safety warnings first!).

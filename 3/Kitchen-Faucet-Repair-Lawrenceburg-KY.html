The most typical washers are typically offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

If you're having problems with your existing water heater-- or you need to get a new one-- don't try to handle it alone.  Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>

<p>Very seldom does any structural damage occur as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically found before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole.

Dripped water normally stays under your home and fills into the ground soil. If the house's foundation was not appropriately compressed, this can potentially trigger a cavity. This is a rare event and in general, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>

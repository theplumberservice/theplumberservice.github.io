<p>Homeowners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric system is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your house.

Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

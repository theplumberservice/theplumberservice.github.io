<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

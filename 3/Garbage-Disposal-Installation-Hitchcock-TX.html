<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

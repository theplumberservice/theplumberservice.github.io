The research study included tests that eliminated hard soils, in addition to assessing shooting and finding. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans in addition to water at 10 gpg firmness level. That cleaning agent cost savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>

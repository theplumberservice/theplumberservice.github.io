<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water entering into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without appropriate pressure reduction. You can also minimize salt, water, and energy by using up to 50% less cleaning agent for laundry and dishwashing, using up to 34% less salt and approximately 35% less water during regeneration.</p>

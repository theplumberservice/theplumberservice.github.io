<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Somers CT</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Gas companies generally do not charge for the initial check out as their priority is to stop any gas leakages or problems. If you have a little leak, your gas costs may be greater than typical.

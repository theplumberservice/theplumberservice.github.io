<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Longs SC</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually kept at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

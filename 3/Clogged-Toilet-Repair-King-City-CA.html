When a brand-new house is constructed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be a fantastic prospect for unclogging your toilet, a more customized plumber must be used for house redesigning work.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually.

Sediment Build-Up: If you see odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element.

To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Toilets can be picky and difficult at times, depending upon what parts have actually stopped working and the specific situation of your installation. Toilet repair or replacement can be a filthy job, something that lots of people might not feel comfortable with doing.

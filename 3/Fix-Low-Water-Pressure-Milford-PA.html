<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Idea: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to installing the disposal. When you connect the P-trap, likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>

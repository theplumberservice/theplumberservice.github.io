Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

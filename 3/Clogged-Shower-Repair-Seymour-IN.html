<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and big are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that goal.

<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed appropriately (Image 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container underneath the area to capture water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>

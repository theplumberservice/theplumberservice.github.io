<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area.

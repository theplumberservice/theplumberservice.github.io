<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Because of their cost, safety and efficiency, copper piping and PEX piping are utilized. Copper piping prevents germs from growing within the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both flexible and light-weight.

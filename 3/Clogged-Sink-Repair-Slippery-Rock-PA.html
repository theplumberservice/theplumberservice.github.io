The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

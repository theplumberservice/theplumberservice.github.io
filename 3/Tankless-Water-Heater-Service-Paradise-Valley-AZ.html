Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

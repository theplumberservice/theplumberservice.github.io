<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>

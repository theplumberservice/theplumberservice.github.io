<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with many house owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>

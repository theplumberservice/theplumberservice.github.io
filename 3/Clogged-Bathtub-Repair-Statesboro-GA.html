<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Considering that 1980, backflow preventers have been lawfully mandated for specific buildings by the New york city Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York. The regulation was not strictly implemented until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes regular random inspections of New York City structures to ensure they are in compliance.</p>

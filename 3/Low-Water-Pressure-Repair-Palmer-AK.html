It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.

Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation.

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public water supply and private on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of defense for the public water system system.</p>
<p>As soon as set up, these BPAs undergo regular and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational efficiency. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific details is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>

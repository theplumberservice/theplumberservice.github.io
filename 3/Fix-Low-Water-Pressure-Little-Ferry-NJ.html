<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Everyday use ought to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you ought to wait till after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

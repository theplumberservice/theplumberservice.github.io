<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

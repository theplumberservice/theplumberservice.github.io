<p>Family owned and ran given that 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing knowledge, house renovating service, and hot water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>

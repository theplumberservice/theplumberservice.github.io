<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement expenses are often comparable, though replacement generally will not need added fees, such as application costs. New meters need to meet policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may require an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Design - Once you include a second floor and even third floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will utilize more products which adds to your labor costs.</p>

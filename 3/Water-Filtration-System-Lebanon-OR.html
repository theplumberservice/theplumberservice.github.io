Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

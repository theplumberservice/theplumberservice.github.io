<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

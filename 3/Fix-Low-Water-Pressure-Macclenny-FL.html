<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are great, but hard or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the usual kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

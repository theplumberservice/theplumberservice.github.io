<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and obligation are exceptionally crucial to developing a reputation for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water supply within a building these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

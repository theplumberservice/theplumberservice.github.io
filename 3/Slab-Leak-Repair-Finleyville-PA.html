<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

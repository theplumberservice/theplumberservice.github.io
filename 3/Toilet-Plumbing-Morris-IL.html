<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

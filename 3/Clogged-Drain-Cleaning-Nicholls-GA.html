<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

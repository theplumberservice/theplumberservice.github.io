<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

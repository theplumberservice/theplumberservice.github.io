<p>If it ends up being difficult to turn; it's most likely you've encountered an obstruction, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain until you hit resistance again, then turn the handle backward and forward to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out periodically to get rid of debris up until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>

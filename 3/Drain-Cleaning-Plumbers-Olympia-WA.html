<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

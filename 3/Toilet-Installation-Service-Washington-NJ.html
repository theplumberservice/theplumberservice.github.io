It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

<p>You rely on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

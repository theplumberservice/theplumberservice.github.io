<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

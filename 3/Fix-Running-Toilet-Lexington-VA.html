<p>Because it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a possible problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any real or possible connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can allow contaminants or pollutants to enter the potable water system. Illness can result from consuming water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

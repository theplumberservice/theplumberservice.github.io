<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and big are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lower degree their residential or commercial property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as a result indicate that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Backpressure takes place when the pressure in a private water system surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger typical circulation to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>

Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

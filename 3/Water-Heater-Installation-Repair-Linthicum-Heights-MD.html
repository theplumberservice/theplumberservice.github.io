<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

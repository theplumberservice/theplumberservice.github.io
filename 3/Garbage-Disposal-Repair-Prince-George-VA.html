<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>No hot water-- The lack of warm water is the most significant indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

It's time to consult the professionals if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>

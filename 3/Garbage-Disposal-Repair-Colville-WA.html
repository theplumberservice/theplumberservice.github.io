<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

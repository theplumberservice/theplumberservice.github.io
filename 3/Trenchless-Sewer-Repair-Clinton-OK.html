<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any available source to attain their goal, however fire department lorries typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or permanent connection in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

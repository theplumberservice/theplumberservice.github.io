<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

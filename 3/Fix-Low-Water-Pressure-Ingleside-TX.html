It is very difficult to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never ever based on tests that are well enough described to permit others to assess them and to validate the results. While the lack of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one be reluctant to accept it without some guarantee of efficiency.</p>

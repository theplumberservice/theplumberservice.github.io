<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to solve the concern. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific process, however easy to treat. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals discovered in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>

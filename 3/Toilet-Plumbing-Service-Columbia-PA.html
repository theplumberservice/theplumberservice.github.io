<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

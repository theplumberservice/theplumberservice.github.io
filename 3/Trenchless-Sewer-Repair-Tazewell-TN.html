<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

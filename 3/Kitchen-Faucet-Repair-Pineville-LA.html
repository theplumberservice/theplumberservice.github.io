The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

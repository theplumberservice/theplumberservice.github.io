<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

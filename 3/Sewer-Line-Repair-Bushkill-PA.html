<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber.

With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>

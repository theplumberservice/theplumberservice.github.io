<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures if utilizing one of these products.</p>

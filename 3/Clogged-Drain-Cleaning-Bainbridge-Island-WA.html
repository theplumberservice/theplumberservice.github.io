<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

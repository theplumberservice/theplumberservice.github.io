<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

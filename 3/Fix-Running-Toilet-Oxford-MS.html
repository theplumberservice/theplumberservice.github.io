<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the buildup of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly. You can combat tough water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>

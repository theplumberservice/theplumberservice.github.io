<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. When this takes place, it generally shows wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up. If you think about what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will also ultimately cause stress on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need a basic tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water prior to taking a look at the pipe beneath.</p>

The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

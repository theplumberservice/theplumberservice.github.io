An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and deterioration within the line.

<h3>Main Line Replace in Inglewood California</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller model that operated on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

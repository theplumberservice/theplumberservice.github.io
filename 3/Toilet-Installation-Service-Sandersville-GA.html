<p>This is among the main and first questions that you need to ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your house is a crucial component to understand whether or not you must repipe your home. This is not only because your plumbing has aged with time, however also since houses that were constructed prior to a particular time period are most likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed years before that, chances are that your house may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>

New meters should satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options. Layout - Once you add a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will utilize more materials which contributes to your labor costs.</p>

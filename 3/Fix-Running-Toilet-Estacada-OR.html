<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Estacada OR</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Was your house developed before the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and decayed throughout the years. Older pipes can cause major leakages and even contaminate your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last forever and will need to be changed.</p>

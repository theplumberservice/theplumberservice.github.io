It is essential that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.

When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through. Due to the fact that of the tight area, the pipes typically make unusual gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>

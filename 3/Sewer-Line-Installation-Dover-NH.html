<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Dover NH</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell frequently related to rotten eggs. This distinctive scent allows you to smell a potential leak if it takes place. Constantly leave if you presume a leak.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we may use a variety of different techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire ports. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and eliminate wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>

<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>

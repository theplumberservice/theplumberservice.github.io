<h3>Clogged Toilet in Martinsville Indiana</h2>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water flows easily from the sink drain into your bucket, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can damage floors, woodworking, and other valuable items such as cabinets. Left unattended, leaking sewer water can result in mold and much more severe structural damage. Leaking sewer water from your main house drain or house sewer can also cause substantial damage if overlooked.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<p>It is not constantly due to obstructions that originate inside the house when drains are clogged.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

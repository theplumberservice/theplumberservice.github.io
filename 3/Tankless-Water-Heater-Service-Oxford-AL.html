<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research study, vacuum, and commercial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure involves covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the material and the pipe streaming through it. This repair method is more suitable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

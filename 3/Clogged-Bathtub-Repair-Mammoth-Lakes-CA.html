It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and total simple repairs, so think about that with the cost when attempting to handle the problem by yourself.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>

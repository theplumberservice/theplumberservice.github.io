<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange occur?

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

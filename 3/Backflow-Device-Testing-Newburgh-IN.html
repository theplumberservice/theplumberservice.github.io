<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections in between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of security for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>A plumbing license shall contain a declaration directing that all work will be performed in accordance with the building files submitted and accepted as part of the application.

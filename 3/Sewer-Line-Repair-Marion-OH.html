<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

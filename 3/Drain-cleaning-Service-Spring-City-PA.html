<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

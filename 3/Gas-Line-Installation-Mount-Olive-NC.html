<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

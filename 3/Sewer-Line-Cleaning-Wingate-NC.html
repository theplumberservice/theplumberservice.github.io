<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

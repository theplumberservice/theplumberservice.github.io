Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur?

Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

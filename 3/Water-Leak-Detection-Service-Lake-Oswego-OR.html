<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>

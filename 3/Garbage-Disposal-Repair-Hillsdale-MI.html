<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must.

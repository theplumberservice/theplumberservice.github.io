<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

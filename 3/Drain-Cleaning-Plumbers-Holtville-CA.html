Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up.

<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance.

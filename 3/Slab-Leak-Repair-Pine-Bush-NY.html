<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>

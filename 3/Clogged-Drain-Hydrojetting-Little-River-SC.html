Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>

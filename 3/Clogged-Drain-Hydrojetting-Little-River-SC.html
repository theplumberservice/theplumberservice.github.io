Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>

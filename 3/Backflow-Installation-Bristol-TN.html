<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractors in Bristol</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Aiming to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? The California Plumbing License Test is needed in order to work as a licensed contractor in California Any individual who plans to work as a plumbing contractor that is responsible for constructing, altering, or repairing a building or structure needs to be licensed. This is especially so if the overall cost of the task is or exceeds $500.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

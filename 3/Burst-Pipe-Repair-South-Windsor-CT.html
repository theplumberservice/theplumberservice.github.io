<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

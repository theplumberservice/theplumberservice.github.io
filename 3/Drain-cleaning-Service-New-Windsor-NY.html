Water pressure might be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

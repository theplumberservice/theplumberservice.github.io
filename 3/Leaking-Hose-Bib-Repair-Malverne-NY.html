<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>

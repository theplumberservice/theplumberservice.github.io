<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.

<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also examine to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that certain magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be efficient in avoiding scale development in difficult water supply. It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well enough described to allow others to assess them and to validate the results.

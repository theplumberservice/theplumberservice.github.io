<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>

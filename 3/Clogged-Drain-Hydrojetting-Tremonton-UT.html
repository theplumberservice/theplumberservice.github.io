<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>This may sound like a joke, however it's really serious if you wish to truly get the most out of your investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist. If you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a building and construction job or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make final changes prior to inspection day. Failing an examination can imply unpleasant hold-ups in your project.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You may need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>

<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>

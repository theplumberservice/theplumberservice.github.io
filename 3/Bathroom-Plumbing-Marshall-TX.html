<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

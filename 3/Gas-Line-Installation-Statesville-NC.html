<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water saves you cash. Decreased Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>

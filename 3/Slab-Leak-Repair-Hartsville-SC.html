<h3>Faucet Replacement in Hartsville South Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Dewitt MI</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

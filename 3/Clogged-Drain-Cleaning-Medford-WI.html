These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<h3>Tankless Hot Water Systems in Roanoke Rapids North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>

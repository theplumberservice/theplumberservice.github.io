<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

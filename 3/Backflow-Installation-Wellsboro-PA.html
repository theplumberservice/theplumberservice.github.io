<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be repaired by replacing that area of harmed piping. However, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your house, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping.
